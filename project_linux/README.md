## **Bioinformatics Projects Summary (Linux CLI)**

This repository holds practical assignments developed during my **Postgraduate Studies in Bioinformatics**, specifically focusing on advanced **Linux Command Line Interface (CLI)** and data management skills, demonstrated across two core components: the **"bioinformatyczny_pipeline_bash_obróbka_sekwencji_FASTA.txt"** (sequence analysis) and a custom Bash Script **"linux_download_repo.sh"** (GitHub automation).



### 1. "bioinformatyczny_pipeline_bash_obróbka_sekwencji_FASTA.txt" (Sequence Analysis)

This project demonstrates practical proficiency in Linux CLI and bioinformatics tools.
Confirms the ability to **automate tasks** (Bash scripts) and create repeatable, **secure analytical workflows with genomic data**, which is crucial for IT/Data Science roles.

**Project Goal:**
Set up of the working environment, management of genomic files (Insulin gene orthologs), data processing, FASTA formatting, and automated analysis via the command line.

**Key Skills:**
Use of AWK, grep, and sed for text data manipulation and motif searching; proficiency in version control (Git); and infrastructure management (Linux CLI, rwx permissions, tar, scp).



### 2. "linux_download_repo.sh" (GitHub Data Retrieval)

This **Bash script** automates the **secure and controlled retrieval of remote data** from GitHub repositories without cloning the entire project (using the **wget** method).
Demonstrates **"Ownership and Accountability Mindset"** through robust **input validation** and operational efficiency for data sourcing, relevant to DevOps and Data Engineering.

**Goal:**
Enable the user to **download a .zip archive** from any public GitHub repository into a newly created, dedicated directory.

**Key Skills:**
Proficiency in **Bash scripting** (input validation **`if [ -z ... ]`**, error handling **`if [ $? -eq 0 ]`**), string manipulation, and managing processes (**`mkdir`, `wget`**).
